# This code is best used when taking a 360 video in a small space where one is in frame of the video

The code projects equirectangular images to cubemap images and it only saves front and back (cubemap_frontnback.py) or left and right (cubemap_leftnright.py)

Cubemap orientation is as such:

            [TOP]
      [LEFT][FRONT][RIGHT][BACK]
            [BOTTOM]
